<p>Ractive.js isn’t an MVC framework in the traditional sense. There are no Model classes, just a plain old array of task objects, and there is only one view object. The app lives in a single file, with two tiny extra files to handle persistence and routing.</p>
<p>This is because Ractive is optimised for developer sanity (as well as performance!). It was initially developed to create interactive news apps at <a href="http://theguardian.com">theguardian.com</a>, which have to be built against punishing deadlines and moving goalposts. Because it embraces reactive programming principles, the developer has less to worry about. Ractive’s API is totally straightforward - you can learn it in 5 minutes and master it in a few hours.</p>
<p>It has a number of innovative features: animations, easier event handling, declarative transitions, first-class SVG support, logical expressions in templates with sophisticated dependency tracking. For many developers, it hits the sweet spot between the flexibility of a library like Backbone and the power of a framework like Angular.</p>
